The foundation of MulleObjC, providing essential classes like NSObject, NSProxy, and specialized classes for memory management, threading, and runtime support.

### [Protocols](protocol/PROTOCOL-DOCUMENTATION.md)

Fundamental protocols that define object behavior, including NSCoding, NSCopying, NSLocking, and MulleObjC-specific protocols for runtime integration.

### [Structures](struct/STRUCT-DOCUMENTATION.md)

Essential data structures used throughout MulleObjC, including NSRange and container callbacks.

### [Functions](function/FUNCTION-DOCUMENTATION.md)

Supporting C functions for the Objective-C runtime, including:

* Runtime support functions
* Memory management functions
* Object property access
* Method invocation helpers
